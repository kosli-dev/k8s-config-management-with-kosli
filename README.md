# Tracking K8S configmaps with Kosli

This is a demo repo to show how to track kubernetes configmaps in Kosli, where the configmaps are synced with google config sync.

### 1. Init configmaps

To start the process

* One Kosli flow per namespace
* One trail per commit on main
* Each configmap is reported as an artifact on the trail
